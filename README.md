### EQE512 MATRIX METHODS IN STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS ###

**Dr. Ahmet AnÄ±l Dindar (adindar - a t - gtu.edu.tr)** 

**2021 Fall**

**Introduction:**

This is a new course in Gebze Technical University- Department of Civil Engineering Graduate Program and has started on 2021 Fall term. The course aims to integrate the structural analysis topics with the computer programs for the graduate level students. 

The programs covered in the course are:
- Flowchart Drawing (Draw.io)
- Spreadsheet programs (MS Excel, Google Spreadsheet)
- Numerical programming (PYTHON)
- Mathematical Calculations (SMATH)
- OpenSeesPy
